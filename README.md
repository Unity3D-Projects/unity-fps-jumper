# Unity-FPS-Jumper
A single-player first-person timed "parkour" game that implements bunnyhopping, surfing, and rocketjumping.
This game was made in Unity, without using assets other than Unity's Standard Assets and those made by me.

The goal of the game is to reach the end of a level as quick as possible.
Best times are stored locally (using XML serialization, as are player settings).
